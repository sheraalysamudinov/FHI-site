                <p>Chui leadership training School started in 2003.
                It's main purpose is to train responsible and
                strong leaders for our society through
                FHI's Vision of Community project.
                Providing with all-round education, 
                expanding a students' world view and 
                strict discipline. In the morning students have 
                «Morning Meditation» exercises. 
                The discussion of different themes 
                allow for deeper reflection. Involving leaders
                in such programs would have additional value, 
                since those involved would
                learn better to express themselves.</p>
